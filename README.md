# CS3050-Temple-Run
An implementation of the mobile app game Temple Run done in python with Python Arcade and arcade-gui. Authored by Annika More, Jamie Birmingham, Ethan Brett, and Sasha Danilov

For our final project for the course CS3050 - Software Engineering, we were assigned to choose either an interactive game, or another some sort of client/server system with a GUI frontend and database backend.
We chose to recreate the game Temple Run. The instructions to run the game are as follows:
there were many issues with both packages (something wrong with their end). When you clone the repo into pycharm, you
then want to make it a virtual environment. Press the button at the bottom right of the screen "Python 3.9
(temple-run)" and then add interpreter, then add local interpreter, and then press "ok".
Once you have done this you want to go into Pycharm -> settings -> Project:temple-run ->
Python Interpreter. On this screen, press the "-" button to delete arcade-gui and arcade if they
are on the menu below it. If they aren't you wanna add arcade-gui FIRST by pressing the "+"
button, specifying the version as 0.1.0a7. Then, even though arcade says itâ€™s installed too, do
the same step to Install arcade again and specify version 3.0.0.dev25. To see the game you must run graphics_driver.py after completing these steps.
If there are any issues when trying to run, please contact me directly and I will help you troubleshoot.
